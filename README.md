Single Search Box Flight Search Application

We are working on a new generation of flight search user interface.
Our main goal is to simplify the process providing a minimalistic single-search-box design which is backed up by natural language processing and information extraction technologies (inspired by Facebook's Graph Search and Chrome's Omnibox). 

During this project we developed a proof-of-the-concept prototype system from scratch and deployed it to Google App Engine: http://easyscn.appspot.com/. We are exploiting SkyScanner's data to test our novel UI approach. Major outcomes of our efforts are smart search box component that support hightlighting, adaptable grammar parser and extraction algorithm tailored for fligh searches.
